What i learned in this activity is that how Git is used to track changes in code and how GitHub serves as an online platform for sharing repositories. I now understand how to initialize a repository, stage files, commit changes, and push them to GitHub. Using GitHub also enables better communication and project management through pull requests, issues, and version tracking, which helps teams build software more effectively.
